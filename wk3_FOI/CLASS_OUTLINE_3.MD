**PREPARATORY WORK**

— Do:
- In your colaboratory notebook: add some text, headings and assign & manipulate some variables
- Find an FOI story from 2020

— Read:

- [Rosenbaum, Martin. “10 things we found out because of FOI”, BBC Online. 2015](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30645383)
- [Burgess, Matt. "FOIA. 103 stories that prove Chris Grayling wrong", 2015](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/oct/30/freedom-of-information-act-chris-grayling-misuse-foi)
- [Burgess, Matthew. "Some of the best stories based on FOI requests in 2017"](https://www.foi.directory/some-of-the-best-stories-based-on-foi-requests-in-2017/)  

**CONCEPTS**

- Background of FOIA
- Workings of FOIA

**PRACTICE**

1. Visit [Whatdotheyknow](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/) and find three potentially useful datasets

2. Brainstorm three FOI requests you might make about:
- Council *staff* (e.g how many sick days did Council staff use last year?)
- Municipal libraries
Now compare with the Claire Miller's [Great Big List](http://clairemiller.net/blog/2013/01/a-great-big-list-of-foi-ideas/)

3. Find the data source online that supplies the following data:

— Rough daily rate of fridges / white goods dumped in Cardiff over the last ten years
— Number of bike thefts recorded by South Wales police (in year ending March 2020)
— Most popular name for baby boys in Anglesey & baby girls in Ceredigion last year
— Number of sheep in Powys over the last ten years
— Were more students getting free school meals last year in Newport or Caerphilly?
— Total number of CCTV cameras in Cardiff (with rough locations)
— How many entries in IMDB mention Wales or Welsh?
— Football banning orders going up / down in England & Wales + why people are arrested


- Using one of the datasets in 3, and the NYT brainstorming questions, interrogate one of the datasets for potential newslines or lines of investigation.
