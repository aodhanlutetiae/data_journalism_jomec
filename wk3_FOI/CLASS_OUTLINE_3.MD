**CONCEPTS**

- Background of FOIA
- Workings of FOIA
- JSON datafiles

**PRACTICE**

1. Visit [Whatdotheyknow](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/) and find three potentially useful datasets

2. Brainstorm three FOI requests you might make about:
- Council *staff* (e.g how many sick days did Council staff use last year?)
- Municipal libraries
Now compare with the Claire Miller's [Great Big List](http://clairemiller.net/blog/2013/01/a-great-big-list-of-foi-ideas/)

3. Find the data source online that supplies the following data:

— Rough daily rate of fridges / white goods dumped in Cardiff over the last ten years
— Number of bike thefts recorded by South Wales police (in year ending March 2020)
— Most popular name for baby boys in Anglesey & baby girls in Ceredigion last year
— Number of sheep in Powys over the last ten years
— Were more students getting free school meals last year in Newport or Caerphilly?
— Total number of CCTV cameras in Cardiff (with rough locations)
— How many entries in IMDB mention Wales or Welsh?
— Football banning orders going up / down in England & Wales + why people are arrested

4. Using one of the datasets in 3, and the NYT brainstorming questions, interrogate one of the datasets for potential newslines or lines of investigation.

5. Read [FOI appeal going to tribunal](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2020-10-22/bureau-launches-action-over-hidden-council-finances)
