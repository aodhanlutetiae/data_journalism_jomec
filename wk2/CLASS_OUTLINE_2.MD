- More pivot tables
- Datawrapper practice
- Article turnaround

**PRACTICE**

"Forbes celebrity richlist.csv"
- pivot table revision
In 2010, which category made the most? How much did models make in 2013?; Which year was the best for athletes in terms of total earnings?; We're supposed to have 15 years, with 100 people listed each year (=1500). But we have more. Get a count of number of people listed for every year; Did the top 100 make more money, on average, in 2006 or 2007?; What were the total earnings of comedians, musicians and hiphop impresarios -- taken as a single group -- in 2017?; What was the lowest-earning year for athletes?

"films_imdb_post2017.csv"
- clean the dataset to fix duplication, incorrect datatypes, typos
- analyse the data (30K rows) for possible newslines

"Covid business charticle.pdf" (file also supplied as "business_data_q3_uk.xlsx")
- download the dataset indicated and produce a charticle
- have it subedited by a classmate

**Note**
Source for "films_imdb_post2017":
This is a file of 30,000 films listed in IMDB. It was built from the files available [here](https://datasets.imdbws.com/). The 'basics' file of over 7 million titles was joined to the 'ratings' file, giving about 1 million titles. All adult titles were removed along with all non-films (tv series etc.) and then all titles from just the last four years were kept, giving a dataset of about 30,000 films from 2017 to 2020.
